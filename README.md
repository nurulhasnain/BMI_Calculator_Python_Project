I've just created a BMI Calculator using Python that makes it super easy to calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI). Your BMI is an important indicator of your overall health, and this tool can help you keep track of it.

Here's how it works:
1. Input your:
   - Name
   - Age
   - Gender
   - Height (in cm)
   - Weight (in kg)

2. Hit enter, and the calculator will provide you with your BMI along with an interpretation of what it means for your health.

Why is this important?
Your BMI can help you assess if you're underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. It's a valuable health metric that can guide your fitness and wellness journey.

I'm really excited to share this tool with you all, and I hope you find it useful! If you're interested in trying it out. I'll share the code with you.
